# pycourse
*pycourse* is a small library used to create NSC course tools. With *pycourse*, PowerPoint slide-text and notes \(narration\) from each slide of a PowerPoint can be extracted, then used to build XML \(used for course configuration\), DOCX \(used for narration recording\), TXT \(used for narration\), and JSON \(used for future h5 course creation\) files. For the program to function properly, however, several \(easy-to-follow\) PowerPoint course standards must be used when initially building a course PowerPoint.

## Feature Support
*pycourse* has the following features:
- Slide text \(text in slide\) extraction as array
- Slide notes \(notes section of slide\) extraction as string
- Get information about the each slide in relation to course + course standards
- Write course to JSON
- Write course narration to XML
- Write course narration to TXT
- Write course narration to DOCX
